# OSAP Social Hub - Connected 2023 Hackathon

## Designed to foster collaborative problem-solving and community building across Africa.

OSAP (Open source African progress) is a gamified social media where individuals, organisations, and communities can meet, share ideas, and work towards solutions that are inspired by challenges peculiar in our world

## Cyberconnect Integration

OSAP is built on top of ccprofiles created via cyberconnect for users. The profiles hold essense nfts which are posts that can be shared publicly, or conditionally with lit protocol.

## Tools

The web3 frontend is built on React, Nextjs, and ethers for contract interaction

- [Cyberconnect]()
- [Lit SDK]()

With Lit we're able to allow users set access control for their post (essense NFT), by default, lit uses an access control, that encrypts and decrypts the content, if the user has at least 1 OSAP Nft in their balacnce

- [Pinata]()
- [Infura]()
